# Proposal
## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Mario and pong

TODO
## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I will be using the Lua programming language and the love framework and learn about game state object-oriented programming, and collision detection. 
TODO
## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO
My project will be following a set of videos and answering the prompts on the module 11 on canvas. writing interactive, graphical games, and in particular implementing versions of Pong and Mario.  Iâ€™ll learn about sprites, graphics, tile maps, gravity, and animation. It will be executed in Lua language. 
## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
TODO, if applicable

None
## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
TODO, if applicable
None
## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
TODO
Learning how to create simple video games with python and coding skills learned from this course.
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
TODO
I think I can accomplish knowing how to do the project and have a working code for the project.
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
TODO
Finish the project and learn a lot of new codes from it.
## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
TODO
1. Watch the videos on Pong and Mario
2. New codes possibly and learn how to use the new codes from video.
3. use the codes learned and make it into a program that works and follows the directions.
